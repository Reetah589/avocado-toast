        <h4>Primitive Data Types:</h4>
            <p>
                undefined: it hasnt been defined, variable that havent set to be anything yet 
                boolean: true or false
                null: means nothing
                string: any sort of text 
                symbol: immutable primitive value that is unique
                number: is a number
                bigint: built-in object whose constructor retusn a bigint primitive   
            </p>   
        <h4>Non-Primitive Data Types</h4>
            <p>
                object: can store a lot of different key value 
            </p>     
        <h4>Variable:</h4>
            <p>
                var: used throughtout the whole program, can be changed
                let: will only be used within the scope of where you declare 
                const: is a variable that can't change
            </p>
        <h4>If/Else/Else If</h4>
            <p>
                if: Use the statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.
                else: Use the statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
                else if: Use this statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
            </p>
        <h4>For Loop/ While Loop</h4>
            <p>
                while loop: this loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true
                for loop: this loops thorugh a block of code a number of times 
            </p> 
        <h4>Switch</h4>
            <p>
                The switch statement is uesed to perform different actions based on different conditions.
                The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
                There is a default code added and if there is no match, the default block code is executed.
            </p>
        <h4>Try / Catch</h4> 
            <p>
                try: this statement lets you test a block of code for errors.
                catch: this statement lets you handle the error in the try block of code.
                throw: this statement lets you create custom errors.
            </p>
        <h4>Promises</h4> 
            <p>
                The promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion 
                (or failure) of an asynchronus operation and its resulting value. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Review Code Flow:
                "this" keyword
                callback
                promises
            </p>
